The HSC is the highest education offered by schools in NSW. It is a certificate of achievements of students completing their final year-11 and year-12 school years. The first HSC was held in 1967 and was a pure examination based certification program until the year 1986 when school based assessments were included as part of the HSC accreditation process. Under the current HSC, 50 per cent of assessment is based on school assessment, and the other 50 per cent is based on an external end-of-year exam. In addition to a broader assessment system, the HSC is now offering students over 90 subjects to choose from.

HSC Curriculum

The NSW Board of Studies (BOSTES) offer HSC students a wide variety of courses to choose from under the following categories [1]:

Board Developed Courses – are courses designed to prepare students for tertiary education, and most of them contribute to the calculation of the Universities Admission Index (UAI) [1]. Courses are fairly diverged with English being the mandatory subject.
Board Endorsed Courses – are courses designed by schools, TAFE or universities accepted by BOSTES as HSC courses but make no contribution to the UAI calculation.
Vocational Education and Training (VET) – are subset of Board Developed Courses and Board Endorsed Courses designed to give students work related skills and often involve work placement.

HSC Assessment Process

The HSC results are a detailed package showing each student the level of knowledge and skills that they achieved in each course with 50% being school-based assessment and 50% being external exam assessment.

School-based assessment tasks measure performance in a wider range of course outcomes than can be tested in an external examination. Students are required to complete a number of assessment tasks for their courses. This may include tests, written or oral assignments, practical activities, fieldwork and projects. Schools submit an HSC assessment mark for every student in every course. BOSTES puts the marks through a process of moderation to allow a fair comparison of marks in each course across different schools [1].

The examination mark for each course shows the student's performance in the HSC examination for that course, which was set and marked by the Board of Studies NSW. The examination consists of a written paper and, for some courses, speaking and listening examinations, practical examinations, or major works that are submitted for external marking. Each student's achievement is assessed and reported against set standards of performance.

Student performance in each HSC course is measured against defined standards. HSC marks for each course are divided into bands and each band aligns with a description of a typical performance by a student within that mark range. The performance bands[1] and descriptions give meaning to the HSC mark. For a 2 unit course, Band 6 indicates the highest level of performance and the minimum standard expected is 50.

Band 6 = 90 - 100 marks
Band 5 = 80 - 89 marks
Band 4 = 70 - 79 marks
Band 3 = 60 - 69 marks
Band 2 = 50 - 59 marks
Band 1 = 0 - 49 marks

HSC Academic Goals

One of the main aims of the new HSC is to make students better qualified to win jobs or go on to higher education when they leave school. HSC’s rich curriculum and a more relaxed subject choosing criteria (only English is mandatory) provides student the opportunity to focus on one or more specific area of studies thus allows students to pursue their career path sooner than later.

The HSC is recognized by all tertiary institutions in Australia, it is not readily recognized by other foreign tertiary institutions (except for commonwealth countries such as UK, Canada, NZ)[4], and students after completing their HSC wishing to study aboard often need to sit through further examinations[5]
